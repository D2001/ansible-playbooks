# Docker Service Backup & Restore Playbooks

This repository provides **Ansible playbooks** to backup and restore any Dockerized service (e.g., `jellyfin`, `paperless`, etc.) on your system.  
The playbooks are fully generic: just set the `service_name` variable to match your service.


run-ansible.sh â€“ Ansible Playbook Runner with Timestamped Logging
==================================================================

Description:
------------
run-ansible.sh is a lightweight wrapper around ansible-playbook that:
- Adds timestamps to each line of output
- Saves logs to a file (default: /var/log/ansible-playbook.log)
- Accepts all standard ansible-playbook arguments
- Works well with tools like Logwatch, Logrotate, or custom parsers

Features:
---------
- Line-by-line timestamping using 'ts' (from moreutils)
- Supports -e, -t, --limit, and other Ansible options
- Appends logs for traceability
- Simple and portable

Requirements:
-------------
- ansible installed
- ts command (part of moreutils)
- Write access to the log file (/var/log/ansible-playbook.log by default)

To install 'ts' on Debian/Ubuntu:
    sudo apt install moreutils

Usage:
------
./run-ansible.sh <playbook.yml> [ansible-playbook options]

Examples:
---------
Run a basic playbook:
    ./run-ansible.sh site.yml

Run with an extra variable:
    ./run-ansible.sh backup.yml -e "service_name=paperless"

Run a specific tag:
    ./run-ansible.sh deploy.yml -t restart -e "env=prod"

Logs:
-----
All output is timestamped and appended to:
    /var/log/ansible-playbook.log

To change the log path, modify the script:
    LOGFILE="$HOME/ansible-playbook.log"

Permissions:
------------
You may need to run the script with sudo if writing to /var/log:
    sudo ./run-ansible.sh playbook.yml

Example Log Output:
-------------------
[2025-06-24 18:00:42] TASK [Install nginx]
[2025-06-24 18:00:43] changed: [web1]
[2025-06-24 18:00:45] TASK [Ensure nginx is running]
[2025-06-24 18:00:46] ok: [web1]

## Features

- **Backup**:  
  - Stops the service's Docker containers.
  - Archives the service directory.
  - Copies the backup to a local directory, an SMB/NAS share, and OneDrive (via rclone).
  - Prunes old backups locally, on NAS, and on OneDrive.
  - Restarts the Docker containers.

- **Restore**:  
  - Finds the latest backup (preferring local, then NAS, then OneDrive).
  - Optionally downloads/copies the backup to local if needed.
  - Removes the existing service directory and restores from the backup.
  - Restarts the Docker containers.

---

## Requirements

- Ansible (tested with 2.9+)
- Docker & docker-compose
- rclone (configured for OneDrive)
- SMB/NAS share mounted at `/mnt/<service_name>/backup`
- User `karsten` must have permissions for all relevant paths

---

## Usage

### 1. **Backup**

Run the backup playbook for any service (default: `temp_service`):

```bash
ansible-playbook backup.yml -e "service_name=jellyfin"
```

You can override `service_name` for any Docker service you want to back up:

```bash
ansible-playbook backup.yml -e "service_name=paperless"
```

### 2. **Restore**

**Warning:** The restore playbook will DELETE your existing service directory and replace it with the latest backup.

Run the restore playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook restore.yml -e "service_name=jellyfin"
```

You will be prompted to confirm the restore.

---

## Customization

- **Change backup retention:**  
  Override `max_backups` (default: 7):

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook backup.yml -e "service_name=jellyfin max_backups=14"
  ```

- **Change backup locations:**  
  Edit the variables at the top of the playbooks if your paths differ.

---

## Notes

- The playbooks assume your Docker service directory is `/home/karsten/<service_name>`.
- Backups are stored locally in `/home/karsten/<service_name>_backups`, on NAS at `/mnt/<service_name>/backup`, and on OneDrive at `onedrive:<service_name>_backups`.
- The playbooks use the `karsten` user for all file operations and Docker commands.
- Ensure your rclone config and SMB mounts are working before running the playbooks.

## Example: Backing up and restoring "paperless"

```bash
ansible-playbook backup.yml -e "service_name=paperless"
ansible-playbook restore.yml -e "service_name=paperless"
```
